"center_c" is the true center of mass of Cluster c (c=1,...,C=4) that I used to generate the dataset. They are included for reference only.
Do not use them at any point of your simulation. You should compare your solutions (in this case, the center of mass "m_c") to this parameter, and give an interpretation for your results.

The row "k" of the matrix "dataset" contains the information of point x_k: first column -> x1_k; second column -> x2_k; thrid column -> cluster it belongs to (for reference only). 
Clusters are numbered from 1 to 4. Cluster 5 represents the outliers.

The remaining variables are self-explanatory.



Please contact me if you have further questions.
